 <h2>Brand Promise</h2>
  <p>
    Snowplow looks forward to working with the security community to find vulnerabilities in order to keep our business, customers and open source community safe.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This policy applies to any digital assets owned by Snowplow, including public facing websites, our open source estate and any data pipelines we are running. We ask that digital assets we operate, but do not own, are excluded from your testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding any assets operated by, but not owned by, Snowplow; we would like to focus your attention on our own estate, not the solutions we spin up for our customers or the technology of our partners. Starting your journey at
    <a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://snowplowanalytics.com</a>
    should keep you in the right zone.
  </p>

  <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
  <p>
    When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the bug. The following issues are considered out of scope:

    <li>Missing best practices in SSL/TLS configuration</li>
    <li>Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS)</li>
    <li>Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector or without being able to modify HTML/CSS</li>
    <li>Rate limiting or bruteforce issues on non-authentication endpoints</li>
    <li>Missing best practices in Content Security Policy</li>
    <li>Missing HttpOnly or Secure flags on cookies</li>
    <li>Missing email best practices (Invalid, incomplete or missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, etc.)</li>
    <li>Vulnerabilities only affecting users of outdated or unpatched browsers (less than 2 stable versions behind)</li>
    <li>Software version disclosure, banner identification issues, or descriptive error messages (e.g. stack traces)</li>
    <li>Tabnabbing</li>
    <li>Open redirect unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated</li>
    <li>Issues that require unlikely user interaction</li>
  </ul>

    Please do not discuss this program or any vulnerabilities (even resolved ones) outside of the program without express consent from the organization.

  <h2>Safe Harbor</h2>
  <p>
